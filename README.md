## OUR Moto:  ``Experiment Learn Innovate``

When theoretical knowledge meets practical experience it creates innovation.
 
## Description

  > Are you satisfied with the practicals done in your college?
  > Does your college have the proper lab equipment?
 
So, Hey we are here with a platform where everyone is free to book their slots for practising  their lab experiments in the best equipped college in their city with the best faculty available.This practice is not limited to your syllabus. If you have a proper knowledge about the subject you can perform any lab irrespective of your subject of study.
 
## Usage

   Lets take a real life scenario:
   
There are many government colleges in West Bengal which have a great academic rank but lack proper lab equipments. 
There the students face a lot of problem in performing their experiments due to lack of proper equipments or outdated equipments. 
So this platform will not only link them to a college but will help them to understand and perform the experiment manually.
